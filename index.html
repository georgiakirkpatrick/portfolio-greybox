                    I grew up in the fair city of Portland, Oregon, where I also earned a biology degree and rejoiced in the nerdy                             intellectualism of Reed College.  Upon graduating, I launched a clothing business inspired by my grandmother's 
                    fabric business and organic cotton farmers in Peru, where I spend a fair amount of time and have the good fortune 
                    of holding citizenship.  I credit entrepreneurship with my cultivation of digital marketing skills and my discovery 
                    of programming.  Enticed by the power of web development, I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and reveled in a newfound                     form of creativity.  When I'm not coding, I manage social media profiles for mission-driven businesses, blog about 
                    women's clothing with pockets, and plot my next trip to the rainforest.
