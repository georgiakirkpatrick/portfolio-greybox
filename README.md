Bloc Assignment 9.3

We used repl.it to demo the wireframe you just saw, but for your own wireframe, you should develop your wireframe locally, using a text editor and previewing in the browser. Once you're done, save your work with Git and push up to a new repo on GitHub. Publish your wireframe with GitHub pages.

When you're done, submit links to the live page and to your repo in the box below.

While you're waiting on feedback, if you choose to continue building out your site, be sure to do your work on a feature branch. You should not make changes to your master branch while your work is being graded.
